                CRUSADER
                <br>
                <img id="crusaderImg" src="../assets/img/crusader.png" alt="crusader">
                <p> Every cause needs a champion, a hero to rally otherwise common men to a righteous cause and lead
                    them to victory. The Crusader is that champion. With holy blade in hand he smites the wicked and
                    sends them back to the darkness from whence
                    they crept. While his armor restricts his movement it affords him great protection, allowing him to
                    stand in the frontlines to take the blows that his weaker comrades cannot.</p>
                <br>
                <p>

                    No matter the pressures he faces he will remain strong, finding strength within himself to keep
                    fighting on while inspiring others to do the same. Even in the midst of battle he can galvanize his
                    allies, giving them the strength to fight off madness for
                    a little longer. When the Crusader is leading the charge, all of hell will know to fear the flame.
                </p>

                <br>
                <img id="vestalImg" src="../assets/img/vestal.png" alt="vestal">
                <p> The warrior nun channels her zeal for battle into healing abilities, holy judgements and dazzling
                    explosions of light. A strong backbone to any party, the Vestal can also hold her own on the front
                    line with a powerful mace bash and close-quarters
                    condemnations.

                <img id="banditImg" src="../assets/img/bandit.png" alt="bandit">
                <p> A bandit seeking redemption on an old road, the Highwayman is one of the fastest classes in the game
                    and is able to dish out a lot of damage quickly. He can be placed in both the front ranks and rend
                    enemies with his short sword, or he
                    can pursue enemies from the back with his trusty pistol. He has a lower HP value than most classes,
                    but makes up for this with high evasion.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>

                    When night falls and all of his allies are settled around a campfire, the Highwayman is preparing
                    for what dangers await. He'll spend his time performing maintenance on his weaponry, practicing his
                    blade-work or setting up alarms to keep himself safe
                    during the night. If he must interact with others it'll be with his dark sense of humor, which might
                    upset some. But for what the Highwayman lacks in tact he makes up in unparalleled finesse. With a
                    flintlock in one hand and a dirk
                    in the other, the Highwayman is sure to make short work of his foes.</p>

                BOUNTY HUNTER
                <br>
                <img id="bounty_hunterImg" src="../assets/img/bounty hunter.png" alt="bounty_hunter">
                <p> Sinister and precise, the Bounty Hunter specializes in targeting a single foe to deliver its head
                    for the reward. He has found that simply striking before thinking is an ineffective way to kill, so
                    he has taught himself many ways to take
                    advantage of his foe's vulnerabilities.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>

                    If they wear armor, he can find the weak points in it. If they are reeling from a hit, he'll make a
                    surprise attack to strike it down. Even the enemies who think they're safe behind their frontlines
                    will find that the Bounty Hunter's grappling hook can
                    pull them in or slice them up. And if all else fails, he can drop flash grenades or sucker punch
                    enemies to disorient them. No matter the situation, this calculating killer will have an answer for
                    it.

                LEPER
                <br>
                <img id="leperImg" src="../assets/img/Leper.png" alt="leper">
                <p> Struggle, and futility — all one's days are a constant toil to shelter life's ember through one more
                    night. The Leper not only knows but embraces such solemnity. Tortured existence has taught him to
                    count not on the care of others. He
                    has learned to channel his energy inward, a kingdom within one man. His power can neither serve nor
                    comfort others; but, drawing on it, he can gain strength others can but dream of, or the endurance
                    to bear what no other could. And
                    when his massive blade falls, death's call rings loud to all caught in its thunderous arc. However,
                    such force falls not nimbly, and foes may lightly evade their execution.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>

                    His dread sickness has given the Leper his name surely as it has taken his body. Huddled by a
                    campfire, its ruinous toll becomes most evident, to himself and those lit by the same flames. Should
                    their mental firmness be tenuous, the Leper may isolate
                    himself to spare their peace of mind; a mercy, paid for with his own well-being. However, if his own
                    solace be paramount, the protection and prison of his mask may be slipped — a calming intoxication
                    of air upon a striken visage. While
                    looking upon such maligned flesh may revolt those he shares the firelight with, true companionship
                    he can always find, meditating on his lofty blade — a once officious weapon, now broken as the man
                    who wields it. In the end, all will
                    meet with death. The Leper sets his sights only on ensuring as many of the twisted horrors of this
                    land as possible attend their final appointment, until his own may be postponed no more.

                MAN AT ARMS
                <br>
                <img id="manatarmsImg" src="../assets/img/manatarms.png" alt="manatarms">
                <p> An old, battle-scarred veteran, the Man-at-Arms has seen enough war and bloodshed to last more than
                    a dozen lifetimes. While he can no longer swing his great mace with the force he once could, you
                    should not stand where he swings his mighty
                    weapon. However it is not offense, but his defense, that makes the Man-at-Arms such a vital member
                    of any team. His ability to read the enemy's movements allows him to draw fire to himself to defend
                    his allies and then retaliate with
                    surprising force.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>

                    The battlefield is a chaotic place, and the Man-at-Arms knows how to make himself heard. With his
                    vociferous shouting he can issue vital commands to his men or let out a terrible bellow to strike
                    fear into the enemy's heart. At camp, the Man-at-Arms can
                    take time to instruct and practice with others, giving efficient information and life saving
                    instruction. As long as the Man-at-Arms stands, he will never allow the line to break.

                    sir. I mean, sir, there's going to be all

                    Having spent some time studying abroad the Librarian finally returns to the Hamlet. While she'd much
                    rather settle down by the hearth with a good book she is often reluctantly dragged out adventuring
                    by her friends and companions. At home among treatises,
                    tales and legends, this humble student of knowledge seeks merely to cram as much valuable
                    information into her skull as possible and keep it there. That being said her companions value her
                    sage advice for all can benefit from the wisdom
                    contained within old stories and folklore.

                <br>
                <p>

                    The book she bears is an evil tome full of forbidden lore. She keeps it close to prevent it from
                    falling into the wrong hands. When asked what kind of hands are "wrong" she will respond "the
                    irresponsible ones".

                    bursting forth in a flurry of harrying
                    bleeds, gnashing teeth, and stunning blows. Should the tide of battle turn, the pair can support an
                    ailing party by protecting the weak, and rallying the stressed.
